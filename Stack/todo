As you grow old, Life doesn't remain the same as it used to be when you were just 12 yr old happy and cheerful boy
But the very fact that I'm not happy has became an integrel part of life. 
Strugging with my purpose. who am i ? why am i? why i'm even here > what is my purpose ? 

Also an interesting thing that i noticed. Is my dream really a dream or reality. 
 --- > while dreaming it's reality. After you wake up, you get to know that it was a dream. 

 what if my entire life is a dream. I'm still dreaming. I don't know.

 As I read more and listen to people, the more I become sure that I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING. 

 as of now, at the time of writing this, Ultimate reality is I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING. 
 Well it's great thing. It keeps me humble. It keeps me grounded.
